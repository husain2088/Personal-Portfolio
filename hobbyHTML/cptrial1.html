                        Joining college marked the inception of a transformative journey into the world of competitive programming for me.<br>
                        It brings me immense pride to share that my dedication and effort recently earned me the title of <span style="color: greenyellow;">Pupil on Codeforces</span>, <br>
                        a testament to the progress and milestones achieved in this captivating journey.<br>
                        With nearly <span style="color:rgb(190, 156, 112)">200 problems</span> conquered on Codeforces and active participation on AtCoder,<br> 
                        each coding challenge is not just a problem to solve but an opportunity for growth and mastery.<br>
                        You can find me on Codeforces under the handle "<span style="color: green;">Kenshi01</span>,<br>
                        where my commitment to the art and science of competitive programming continues to flourish.<br>
